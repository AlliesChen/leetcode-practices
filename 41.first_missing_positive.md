# 41. First Missing Positive

Question: [First Missing Positive - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/description/)

## Solution

Use a boolean array -- the method comes from [the video](https://youtu.be/P9OSkJOVf6U?si=a_d68W8mMYDGZaIS) on the YouTube channel - [mConding](https://youtu.be/P9OSkJOVf6U?si=twemUR-S6QncvPiP)

```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        found = [True] + [False] * len(nums)
        for x in nums:
            if 0 < x < len(nums) + 1:
                found[x] = True
        for i, f in enumerate(found):
            if not f:
                return i
        return len(nums) + 1
```

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(n)

## With Cyclic Sort

This method is base the editorial, as describe in [this solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-missing-positive/solutions/4926091/5-interview-approaches-with-video-explanation-cyclic-sort-binary-search-set-brute-force). First, it employs the [cyclic sort algorithm](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-a-cyclic-sort-algorithm) to place each positive number at the index of `the_number - 1` in the list of numbers. Next, it traverses the list starting from index 0. The first integer that does not match its position-- put simply, if `index + 1` is not equal to `the_number`-- represents the missing positive. If every number in the list is the correct position, the smallest missing positive should be `the_number + 1`.

```python
class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            while 0 < nums[i] <= n and nums[nums[i] - 1] != nums[i]:
                nums[nums[i] - 1], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i] - 1]
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] != i + 1:
                return i + 1
        return n + 1
```
